# Security Policy - Demo Project

## About This Document

This security policy covers the **boost-conan-cmake** demonstration project, which showcases integration of C++ libraries and security automation tools. As this is primarily an educational/demonstration project, the security policy reflects that scope.

## Versions Supported

This demonstration project maintains security scanning for:

| Version | Security Support |
|---------|-----------------|
| main branch | ✅ Active security scanning |
| tagged releases | ✅ Security scanning for 90 days after release |

## Reporting Security Issues

### For Demo Project Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this demonstration project:

1. **GitHub Security**: Use [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/Fabio3rs/boost-conan-cmake/security/advisories) (preferred)
2. **Email**: Send details to fabio3rs@gmail.com with `[SECURITY-DEMO]` prefix

### For Dependencies

This demo project uses third-party libraries. For security issues in:
- **Boost Libraries**: Report to the [Boost Security Team](https://www.boost.org/users/security/)
- **fmt Library**: Report via [fmt GitHub Security](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/security)
- **xlnt Library**: Report via [xlnt GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tfussell/xlnt/issues)

### Information to Include

Please provide:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact
- **Reproduction**: Detailed steps to reproduce
- **Environment**: System versions, compiler, dependencies
- **Suggestion**: Fix suggestions if available

## Response Process

### Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: 48 hours for receipt confirmation
- **Analysis**: 7 days for initial analysis and severity classification  
- **Resolution**: 
  - **Critical**: 24-48 hours
  - **High**: 7 days
  - **Medium**: 30 days
  - **Low**: 90 days

Note: Response times may be longer for this demo project compared to production projects.

### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation
- **High**: Authentication bypass, sensitive data exposure
- **Medium**: Limited injection, DoS, information leakage
- **Low**: Configuration issues, informational findings

## Demonstration Security Features

This demo project showcases several security automation features:

### Automated Security Scanning
- ✅ **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- ✅ **CVE Scanner**: Vulnerability checking with OSV.dev integration
- ✅ **Gitleaks**: Secrets detection in code and history
- ✅ **Trivy Scanner**: Container and filesystem vulnerability analysis
- ✅ **Semgrep**: Static code security analysis
- ✅ **Hadolint**: Dockerfile security best practices
- ✅ **SARIF Upload**: GitHub Security tab integration

### Build Security Features
- ✅ **Hardening Flags**: Stack protection, format security, PIE
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: clang-tidy for code quality
- ✅ **Dependency Validation**: Conan package integrity checking
- ✅ **Secure Defaults**: Security-focused CMake configuration

### Container Security
- ✅ **Multi-stage Builds**: Reduced attack surface
- ✅ **Minimal Runtime**: Alpine-based runtime images
- ✅ **Non-root Execution**: Security-focused container design
- ✅ **Dependency Scanning**: Base image vulnerability analysis

## Demo Usage

This project demonstrates security scanning integration patterns. For production use:
- Review and adapt security configurations to your needs
- Implement additional security controls as required
- Conduct regular security assessments beyond automated scanning
- Follow your organization's security policies and procedures
